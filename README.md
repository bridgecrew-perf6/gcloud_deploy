Hello! This is a very simple Flask app (an emoji parser) for purposes of testing Google Cloud's App Engine.   
As of writing, the url is live (i.e. the attempt worked), but as of reading, ðŸ¤·

The site uses Python/Flask and has two basic endpoints:

/?emoji={emoji_name}    
This returns a welcome message where {emoji_name} is one of the emoji strings returned by /all.    
If emoji_name == None, it gives a welcome message.   
Sample route: https://bpoeter-trial.uc.r.appspot.com/?emoji=snake

/all   
Returns a dictionary of all the emojis and their names from emojis.txt.   
You can use any of these in the ?emoji= route above.   
Sample usage: https://bpoeter-trial.uc.r.appspot.com/all
